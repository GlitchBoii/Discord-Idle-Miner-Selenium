# idle Miner selenium
You will have to have selenium installed (Tutorial: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-selenium-in-python/)
Once you got selenium setup you will have to specify the chromedriver path in code, you will also have to change username and password field to your discord login credentials.
Last thing you'll have to do is change the xpath on line 21 to idle miner server xpath (Check tutorial for info how to get xpath)
